## How to Use This File

**For Agents Starting Work**:
1. Check relevant module sections before implementation
2. Review "Patterns & Anti-Patterns" for established conventions
3. Note any integration requirements that affect your work

**For Planner Completing Tasks**:
1. After moving task to `5-done/`, read the review file
2. Extract high-signal insights (not everything, just what's reusable)
3. Append entries under appropriate sections
4. Always include task ID for traceability
